I always did this with PyCharm, 

Please keep the tab open, so we can monitor if it crashes, I have written you api id and api hash, 
I have written the ids of the channel, so it should work. How frequent the source channel makes post? we need it instant. If the admins of channel posts, we will see
shall i test now 
if you are the admin, yes , please
lets trz
it says that the input id is not found, can you please send me channel invite links, so I can take a look
sure
can you send me target too, please?

those are the target and source,

but then we need to set up another target and source on another phone number

it asks for 2FA


sorry for inconvinience

we need another pair of ids
fir channels? yes, it is source channel
my_channel is target channel

no they both work in different phones
so what you are doing is correct
so we need api id and api hash of third account, yes?

it is only 2

we did this first
source - target
1285034799 -1376355233
this one is with this phone

we have done this with this number?
yes the first one

4915908463607

now we are doing this
Source - target
1408408426 - 1285034799
this one is with this phone
okay
491718058125

so you have 2 pairs of channel in one account?


why 3?!
it should be just 2 

it is from 1 to 2   anonim.py is for 1st account 1st phone
and from 2 to 3    anonim2.py is for 2nd account 2nd phone

no

the main source is here
1408408426  
this send to 1285034799

those are common


then 1285034799 send to 1376355233
we did this already with 1




1st phone number: 1st ---- 2nd (channels) so we should do it? yes
Source - target
1408408426 - 1285034799
491718058125 //we have to do this, okay, there is no need anonim3 correct

2nd phone number: 2nd ---- 3rd ? we started by this first so this is done
correct
why?
if you delete, we lose what we did here

it is just a session file 

ok

we run the code on different IP addresses simultaneously,  so it crashed



I have to figure out why it crashes ok\why not update the anonim too?which part of anonim? use the new files that you just run. There is no need, ok. I will say something after it works


sir, I don't know why it doesn't work. I am sorry, I took a lot of your time, if you find anyone who can do it, hire him

i will work on deploying the scripts wih my own accounts, if i find solution, i will let you know. but right now I don't want to waste your time, I am very  okay try to think of a solution, i will try something up till then
